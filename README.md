## Reproducing Results

- Scripts used for our final report can be found in `R/`.
  - `loading-data.R` performs data scraping and centralizing of large data files to a shared google drive. This contains functions that load in large amounts of data (that are now already processed and saved), and can be skipped when reproducing results
